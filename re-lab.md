# AFP 2015 re-lab opportunity

As announced by the end of the course, in connection with the written
re-exam we also organise a "re-lab" for those who tried but failed the
labs during study period 3 2015 (or who want to improve their grade).
If you hand in solutions to the labs + book a slot by 2015-08-17 (the
week before the written re-exam) and present your solution to us in
room EDIT 5468 during your discussion slot on 2015-08-21, then you
will be graded again on the lab without having to wait for 2016. (The
purpose of the short individual presentation is to make sure you
actually understand your solution.)

So, if you failed on the labs in the spring and want to try again,
please use this doodle:

for booking a discussion slot (deadline 2015-08-17).

We will not re-open the Fire submission system this time - just zip up
and submit your files as an attachment to a mail to patrikj at
chalmers.se (_not_ as a reply to the afp15 group;-).

Good luck,
  Patrik

Dates:
* 2015-08-17: AFP re-lab hand-in (+ presentation no later than Friday 2015-08-21)
