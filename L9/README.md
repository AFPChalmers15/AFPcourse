Title: Designing EDSLs by combining Deep and Shallow Embeddings

I will present a design pattern for embedded DSLs (EDSLs) where a
combination of deep and shallow embeddings is used in order to get
most advantages from both approaches. This approach has been
successfully used in Feldspar which is an EDSL for high-performance
numeric computations. I will also introduce Feldspar and discuss some
details of its implementation.
