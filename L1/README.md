The first lecture of the 2015 instance of the AFP course covered:
* [AFP course page](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/afp/): administrative information about the course
* [Haskell recap](src/Lect1.hs): This code was presented in a [slide show](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/afp/lectures/lecture1/lecture1.pdf)
* [First complete Haskell example](src/Signal.hs): Just the module header - we'll come back to it in [L2](../L2/).

---

Future work:
* Perhaps use https://github.com/gnab/remark for the slides.
* [Small experiment](slides.html)
