* L4: Parsing: a case-study in program transformation
* L5: Monad Transformers, part 1: how to build your monad from transformers
* L6: Monad Transformers, part 2: more transformers
* L7: Specification, verification and testing (QuickCheck)
* L8: Exercise session based on exams from earlier years
* L9: EDSL guest lecture by Emil Axelsson
* L10: More QuickCheck: Generating, shrinking, etc.
* L11: Prel. Type based modelling in Haskell, part 1

# Schedule

Due to large interest the lectures have been moved to bigger rooms
starting 2015-01-26 (study week 2). The resulting schedule looks a bit
messy, but we will have lots of more air to breath.
