Advanced Functional Programming
---------

Some material connected to the Chalmers and Univ. of Gothenburg course.

Main course homepage:
* http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/afp/

This github repository aims at collecting all the relevant open source
code associated with the AFP course. It is currently (Jan-Mar 2015)
under construction with material being migrated from the main course
home page step by step.

Grading
-------

The final grade of the course is a based on a weighted average of the
lab grade and the exam grade (provided that both are at least "Pass").
The weights are the number of credits: 4.5cr (60%) for the labs and
3cr (40%) for the exam. Among the labs, number 2 has a higher weight.

In March 2015 the final result is
* 68 did the lab  (50 passed, 18 failed)
* 57 did the exam (27 passed, 30 failed)
and 26 passed both the exam and the labs.

These numbers may be adjusted after the "exam check" (granskning)
opportunities Mon 2015-04-13 and Tue 2015-04-14. Both at 12.45-13.10
in my office (EDIT 5468) or in the nearby corner room if we need more
space.

Lecture plan:
------------

* [L1](L1/): Course intro, Haskell recap, first DSL example
* [L2](L2/): EDSLs and the Shapes example
* [L3](L3/): Monads: how to build your own monad from scratch
* L4: [Monads](L3/) and [Parsing](L4/): a case-study in program transformation
* L5: [Parsing](L4/) and [Monad Transformers](L5/), part 1: how to build your monad from transformers.
* L6: [Monad Transformers](L5/), part 2: more transformers and the extensible interpreter
* [L7](L7/): Exercise session based on exams from earlier years
* [L8](L8/): Specification, verification and testing (QuickCheck)
* L9: [EDSL guest lecture](https://github.com/emilaxelsson/deep-shallow-edsl) by [Emil Axelsson](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~emax/)
* [L10](L10/): More QuickCheck: Generating, shrinking, etc.
* [L11](L11/): Type based modelling in Haskell, part 1: GADTs
