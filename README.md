Advanced Functional Programming
---------

Some material connected to the Chalmers and Univ. of Gothenburg course.

Main course homepage:
* http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/afp/

This github repository aims at collecting all the relevant open source
code associated with the AFP course. It is currently (Jan-Mar 2015)
under construction with material being migrated from the main course
home page step by step.

Lecture plan:
------------

* [L1](L1/): Course intro, Haskell recap, first DSL example 
* [L2](L2/): EDSLs and the Shapes example
* [L3](L3/): Monads: how to build your own monad from scratch
* L4: [Monads](L3/) and [Parsing](L4/): a case-study in program transformation
* L5: [Parsing](L4/) and [Monad Transformers](L5/), part 1: how to build your monad from transformers. 
* L6: [Monad Transformers](L5/), part 2: more transformers and the extensible interpreter
* L7: Exercise session based on exams from earlier years
* [L8](L8/): Specification, verification and testing (QuickCheck)
* L9: [EDSL guest lecture](https://github.com/emilaxelsson/deep-shallow-edsl) by [Emil Axelsson](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~emax/)
* [L10](L10/): More QuickCheck: Generating, shrinking, etc.
* [L11](L11/): Type based modelling in Haskell, part 1: GADTs
* [L12](L12/): Agda tutorial
* [L13](L13/): Type based modelling in Haskell, part 2: Type families
* L14: Program derivation: Maximum segment sum (guest lecture by [Cezar Ionescu](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~cezar/))
* L15: Exercise session based on exams from earlier years
* L16: (Perhaps repetition)

# Schedule

Due to large interest the lectures have been moved to bigger rooms
starting 2015-01-26 (study week 2). The resulting schedule looks a bit
messy, but we will have lots of more air to breathe.
