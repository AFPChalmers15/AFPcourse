##Sammanfattning (Summary)

Good, interesting course well organised teaching.
Hard, lots of work (high workload) but learn a lot. Need to be prepared to work hard, but some of the best teaching.

Gap between initial FP-course on bachelors level and AFP. But students also felt APF is nicely self contained and would not like to remove any material. However, and intermediate level functional programming course might be missing. One hope is that this will be remedied when the obligatory course Programming Language Technology, which use Haskell for labs, moves to period 2, before AFP.

##Lärandemål (Learning outcomes)
Very clear.

##Genomförande (Realization)
Generally happy with teaching. Labs are good but some are very time consuming.

Assessments, course administration worked well.

The workload for the course is very high, especially for the labs.

##Arbetsklimat (Study climate)
Cooperation with the teachers worked well.


##Önskade förändringar (Desired changes)
Lab descriptions will be clarified with specifications for what’s required for grades 3, 4 and 5 for different ambition levels. This might also help with reducing the workload for those students not aiming for the highest grade.
