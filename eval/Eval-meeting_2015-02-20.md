## Student comments 2015

For reference: [Last year's evaluation](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/afp/eval.html#apr2014)

Jeff: recordings would be great. (Patrik: I know, and I will try to find time to set that up.) Lab grading? (Patrik: There should be feedback for each Part II lab assignment: 3=Pass, 4=Good, 5=Very good.)

Peach: recording wanted. Assignment desciptions: too much space for your own interpretation? (Patrik: please send in concrete improvement suggestions via email or Pull requests on github.)

Niklas: Lab questions occur often, but TAs provide very good feedback. Good feedback through fire as well. Discussion time wanted in the second half of the week. Spread it out more evenly, but keep most of it in before Wed.

Jack: Agree with the above. Esp. with the videos. Mostly works very well. Quite a hard course, but adequate.

Maria: Agree with most of the above. A bit difficult to follow the final code if you missa lecture. Disc. time wanted in the second half of the week (as above). Second lab PM was a bit hard to understand which leads to unneccessary rejections (maybe). (Fabian: I can see that this could be a problem. Will try to improve until next year. Please send in concrete improvement suggestions.)

Johan: (Mostly agree.) Some feedback: either too much freedom (in lab 1) or too specific rejections. Exam question exercise session good: more please! Good idea would be to ask the whole group to send comments to the student reps. before the evaluation meetings.

Jeff: Suggestion: organize a TA session with feedback on common lab questions / descriptions / expectations (including grading). (Patrik: good idea - mainly for next year, but perhaps already for lab 3.)

## Course survey form (FYI)
