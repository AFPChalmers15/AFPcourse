Course survey TDA342 Advanced functional programming

The only question which is mandatory to answer is the question about your overall impression of the course, but we would appreciate if you could answer all the questions.

If you write comments, we encourage you to write them in a constructive manner (if you write that something has worked well or less well, also state why), so that we can use them to develop the course before the next round. Your comments are anonymous and cannot be linked to you.

This questionnaire begins with a set of questions which are the same for all courses at Chalmers and for GU courses organised by Chalmers. If a person responsible for the course has chosen to add their own questions to the questionnaire, you will find these after the general questions.

If you write comments, please keep them factual and constructive. Offensive comments will be removed.
