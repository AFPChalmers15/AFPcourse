The trial exam today was composed of the following four problems taken
from old exams.

* Problem 1 was taken from the [2010-08 exam](../exam/2010-08/AFP_exam.pdf), problem 2
* Problem 2 was taken from the [2012-03 exam](../exam/2012-03/AFP_exam.pdf), problem 1
* Problem 3 was taken from the [2012-03 exam](../exam/2012-03/AFP_exam.pdf), problem 3
* Problem 4 was taken from the [2013-03 exam](../exam/2013-03/AFP_exam.pdf), problem 3

The respective exams, and some sample solutions, are available on the
[course homepage](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/afp/exam.html). In
fact, it seems like every AFP exam gets archived there.
