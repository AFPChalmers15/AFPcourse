The trial exam today was composed of the following four problems taken
from old exams.

* Problem 1 was taken from the August 2010 exam ([1], problem 2) 
* Problem 2 was taken from the March 2012 exam ([2], problem 1) 
* Problem 3 was taken from the March 2012 exam ([2], problem 3) 
* Problem 4 was taken from the March 2013 exam ([3], problem 3) 

The respective exams, and some sample solutions, are available on the 
course homepage[0]. In fact, it seems like every AFP exam gets archived 
there.
