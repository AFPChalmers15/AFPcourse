# AFP RWH coverage 2015
This is a summary of what parts of the Real World Haskell book
students should know after the course (including some parts that
students should know before the course).

Note that the AFP course also covers some aspects not covered by the
RWH book: parts of the lectures on EDSLs (L2), Program transformation
(L3, L4), and Type based modelling (L11, L12, L13), and the guest
lectures by Emil (L9) and Cezar (L14).
