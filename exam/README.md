AFP course exam questions and proposed solutions for the last few years.

Note that the course plan (including the learning outcomes) have
changed a bit over the years, so more recent exams are more likely to
match the current course instance.

Pull-requests to clean up the code, add cabal files, explanations
etc. are welcome.

2015-03-15: An overview of exam questions from earlier years with an
attempt at classifying them by learning outcome. I (Patrik Jansson)
have been the teacher from 2010 onwards so earlier exams may not "fit"
in this classification scheme.
