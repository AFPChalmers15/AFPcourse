	 <h2> Description </h2>
This lab assignment asks you to implement a library for so-called <EM>turtle
    graphics</EM>. The library will be interfaced to as an <EM>embedded
    language</EM>. Several extensions are then made to the original turtle
    language.

    <P>

    We recommend that you implement the graphics part of the lab using
    <a HREF="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/HGL">HGL</a>, a simple
    graphics library with just enough features for this assignment.
    If you prefer (or if you plan on using 3D) you may use one of the
    <a HREF="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Opengl">OpenGL</a> libraries
    or you may use
    <a HREF="http://projects.haskell.org/gtk2hs/">gtk2hs</a>. If you would
    like to use a different graphics library please ask before
    starting the assignment.

    <h3>Turtle Graphics</h3>

    <P>
    The idea of turtle graphics was originally part of the <B>Logo</B> programming
    language. It originated from an environment where a real robot (the "turtle")
    could move around and act on simple commands. The two basic commands it
    understood were:

<pre><b>
forward n
right d</b></pre>

    Here, <B>n</B> is the number of steps the robot should move
    forward, and <B>d</B> the number of degrees the robot should
    turn. More information can be found on the <A
    HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle
    graphics</A> wikipedia page (or in a local copy of the <a
    href="logo_primer_2007.pdf">"Logo primer"</a>).


    The idea is that you will implement a part of this turtle graphics language.
    Your program will be able to produce something like the following output:

    <P>
    <CENTER>
    <IMG SRC="images/turtle-tree.gif" alt="[Turtle tree]">
    </CENTER>

    <P>

    Below are a number of tasks. Needless to say, please <B>read these
    carefully</B> and make sure you do not miss parts of an assignment! Most
    assignments require coding <B>and</B> descriptions + motivations of
    what you have done. Most of the descriptions should be in the form of
    <a HREF="http://www.haskell.org/haddock/">Haddock</a> comments for modules
    and fuctions. There are also several questions in this description, make
    sure you answer all of them in your report.
       </div>

<a name="part1"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part I </h2>
Deadline: Wed Jan 28
    <p>
    The first part of this assignment is just to get you started. You should
    get started on Part II before the deadline for Part I.
       </div>

<a name="task1a"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part I - Task 1 - Free code! </h2>
Download and unpack this <a href="files/turtle-graphics-0.1.0.0.tar.gz">stub cabal package</a>.
    The archive contains a file structure and some useful code snippets for you to build your
    implementation on. You are free to modify the package however you wish or build a new
    package from scratch, but if you deviate significantly from the structure in the stub file
    you may want to explain why your version is an improvement.

    <p>

    Make sure "cabal configure", "cabal build" and "cabal haddock" works (switch the contents of the files to match the graphics framework you are using if not HGL).
    Look through the contents of the package and the generated documentation, run the generated executable and make sure it works.

    Fill in or replace the fields in the .cabal file with the appropriate information.

    <p>

    Familiarise yourself with the graphics library you are using by writing a
    simple program which opens a window and draws something in it (the provided code
    already does this for HGL, but make sure you understand how it is used).
       </div>


<a name="task1b"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part I - Task 2 - Library interface </h2>
The turtle graphics language should be implemented as an embedded language
    library in Haskell. The turtle language should be provided to the user as a
    single module, exporting abstract datatypes and operations.

    <p>

    An important part of creating an embedded language is to think carefully
    about what interface you want to offer to the user. Think about
    <i>compositionality</i> (how easy is it to combine simpler programs to
    build more complex ones?), and <i>abstraction</i> (hiding irrelevant
    implementation details from the users).

    <p>

    For instance, your library might define and export the following things
    (different types are conceivable, as long
    as they implement the same basic functionality):

<pre><b>
type Program <span class='hs-comment'> -- the abstract type of a turtle program</span>
forward :: Double -> Program
right   :: Double -> Program
...</b></pre>
    Other turtle commands you should provide are:
    <b>penup</b> and
    <b>pendown</b> - stop drawing and start drawing respectively,
    <b>color</b> - changes the color of the turtle's pen, <b>die</b> -
    "kills" the turtle (rendering it unable to perform any more actions),
    <b>idle</b> - a program that does nothing,
    <b>limited</b> - makes the turtle stop what it is doing after a specified period of time
    (by some definition of time not directly related to minutes and
    seconds),
    <b>lifespan</b> - kills the turtle after a specified period of time,
    <b>backward</b> and <b>left</b> - self explanatory,
    <b>times</b> - repeats a turtle program a certain number of times,
    and <b>forever</b> that repeats a program forever.

    You will also need a sequencing operator (<b>&gt;*&gt;</b>) to perform commands
    one after another.

    <p>

    For running programs, in addition to the graphical interface your program
    should provide a simple
    textual interface that prints what happens in sequential order, i.e.
    prints a description of the actions that the turtles perform at each "step"
    in time (which lines are drawn, what action turtles perform or any other representation of what is going on will suffice).
    The textual interface needs to be productive for infinite turtle
    programs like those created with forever (it should go on printing the
    actions indefinitely). The graphical interface only needs to handle
    infinite programs for grades 4 or 5.

    <p>

    Write down the interface of your library, like in the example above,
    listing the types you plan to export (you may sketch definitions for them, but
    it is not needed for this part) and type
    signatures for the operations. When appropriate add explanations of what
    your operations are intended to do. Make sure you don't forget to add
    at least one <i>run</i> function for your programs (the types of the
    run functions may be a bit sketchy at this stage, but explain what each
    of them do in their comments).
       </div>

<a name="task1c"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part I - Task 3 - Example </h2>
Write down the <b>spiral</b> example from Logo language
    using your interface. In their syntax it looks like:
    <P>
    <CENTER>
    <TABLE>
    <TR>
    <TD ALIGN=center><IMG SRC="images/turtle-spiral.gif" alt="Turtle spiral"><BR>
    spiral 0 91
    </TD>
    <TD>
    <PRE>
    <B>
      to spiral :size :angle
        if :size > 100 [stop]
        forward :size
        right :angle
        spiral :size + 2 :angle
      end
    </B></PRE>
    </TD>
    </TABLE>
    </CENTER>
    You won't be able to run your spiral example yet, but it should type check.
    <p>

    Also, make one version of the spiral example that goes on forever. Can you
    define the limited version in terms of the unlimited one?

    <p>

    Finally make a program that draws a finite spiral and when done starts drawing
    an infinite spiral where the finite spiral ended.
       </div>

<a name="part2"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part II </h2>
Deadline: Wed Feb 4
    <p>
    In this part of the assignment you will implement your turtle language and
    write a report.
       </div>

<a name="task2b"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part II - Task 1 - Implementation </h2>
Implement the library you designed in Part I. Clearly separate primitive and
    derived operations, and try to keep the set of primitive operations as small
    as possible.

    <p>

    At this point you might realise that the interface you've designed is
    missing some operations, or that parts of it are difficult to implement.
    Don't hesitate to change the interface in these cases--just be clear about
    what you changed and motivate why the change was needed (in your report or in
    the documentation for the relevant functions).

    <p>

    Make sure that you carefully define the borders of your library by
    exporting only the things you want a user to see (the interface you've designed).

    <p>

    <b>Question</b>: What definition of time do you use (what can a turtle achieve
    in a single time unit)?
       </div>

<a name="task2c"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part II - Task 2 - Parallel composition </h2>
Add a <em>parallel composition</em> combinator to your turtle language.
      One possible interface parallel composition could have is:
      <pre><b>(<|>) :: Program -> Program -> Program</b></pre>
      When you run a turtle program <b>p <|> q</b>, there will be
      two turtles, one running <b>p</b> and the other running <b>q</b>, in
      parallel. In your textual interface you should show which actions occur
      in parallel.

      <p>

      <b>Questions</b>: What happens after a parallel composition finishes? Is your
      parallel composition commutative, is it associative? (To answer this
      question you must first define what it means for programs to be equal.)
      What happens if a turtle runs forever only turning left in parallel with
      another turtle running the spiral example? Does your textual interface
      handle this situation correctly, if not - how would you fix it?

      <p>
      <b>Question:</b> How does parallel composition interact with lifespan and limited?
      (lifespan does not need to correspond realistically to actual life spans, just specify how it works.)
      </p>
       </div>

<a name="task2d"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part II - Task 3 - Additional operators </h2>
<b>This task is required only for grade 4 or 5.</b>

  <p>

  Add a new module TurtleExtras to your cabal package. This module should contain
  some derived operators that you think may be a useful addition to the language.
  Try to add higher level components like squares and other geometrical shapes as
  well as operators that capture common patterns.

  <p>

  Operators that demonstrate the flexibility of your turtle language are encouraged.
  See the <a href="lab1grading.html">grading page</a> for more hints.
       </div>




<a name="task2f"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part II - Task 4 - Examples </h2>
Implement a few examples that together use all of the constructs you have
    implemented. (Do this in a different module that imports the module
    defining the embedded language.) Make sure that you have at least one program
    that does not terminate, and show that the textual interface can handle this.

    <p>

    Also choose your "favorite" turtle
    program, resulting in a cool picture or animation. This program should
    be the main function of your executable module, so building your cabal package
    yields an executable that runs the program in graphical mode.
       </div>

<a name="task2g"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part II - Task 5 - Thoughts and reflections </h2>
Answer the following questions:

    <ol> <li> Start by answering all the questions in the Assignment description above. </li>
         <li> Did you use a shallow or a deep embedding, or a combination?
                             Why? Discuss in a detailed manner how you would have implemented
                             the Program type if you had chosen the other approach. What
                             would have been easier/more difficult? </li>
         <li> Compare the usability of your embedding against a custom-made
                             implementation of a turtle language with dedicated syntax and
                             interpreters. How easy is it to write programs in your embedded
                             language compared to a dedicated language? What are the
                             advantages and disadvantages of your embedding? </li>
         <li> Compare the ease of implementation of your embedding against a
                             custom-made implementation. How easy was it to implement the
                             language and extensions in your embedded language compared to a
                             dedicated language? What are the advantages/disadvantages of
                             your embedding? </li>
         <li> In what way have you used the following programming language
                             features: higher-order functions, laziness, polymorphism? </li> </ol>

    <b>Required only for grade 5</b> (but helpful for grade 4):
    Characterize the relationships between your operators as a set of algebraic laws.

    For inspiration look at the laws of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring">algebraic semirings</a>, also look at the laws for the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Data-Monoid.html">monoid typeclass</a> and possibly other type classes like <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.3.1.0/docs/Control-Applicative.html">Applicative/Alternative</a>.
    Also, consider the following:
    <ul>
    <li>How does &lt;|> and >*> interact? </li>
    <li>How does idle and die interact with your combinators? </li>
    <li>How does forever and times interact with your combinators? </li>
    <li>Can you find any law that is unexpected, unintuitive or undesired, but follows from your operators? </li>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <b>Question</b>:Is your program data type a Monoid? Under which operations? There may be several possible Monoid instances. Would it be a Monoid if some small change was made to your operators?
       </div>

<a name="submission"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Submission </h2>
<h3>Deadline</h3>

  The deadline for the first part is Wed Jan 28 and the deadline for
  the second part is Wed Feb 4. The final deadline is Sun Mar 22. (Please read <A HREF="assignments.html#rules">the rules</A>
  on what first and final deadline mean.) Each part of the assignment should
  be submitted in its corresponding task in the <a href="https://xdat09.ce.chalmers.se/afp/">reporting system</a>.

  <h3>Clean Code</h3>

  Before you submit your code, Clean It Up! Submitting clean code is Really
  Important, and simply the polite thing to do. After you feel you are done, spend
  some time on cleaning your code; make it simpler, remove unnecessary things,
  etc. We will reject your solution if it is not clean. Clean code:

  <UL>
  <LI>Does not have long lines (&lt; 80 characters)
  <LI>Has a consistent layout
  <LI>Has type signatures for all top-level functions
  <LI>Has good comments for all modules, functions, data types and instances. The comments should look good when compiled to HTML with Haddock.
  <LI>Has no junk (junk is unused code, commented code, unnecessary comments)
  <LI>Has no overly complicated function definitions
  <LI>Does not contain any repetitive code (copy-and-paste programming)
  </UL>

  <h3>Submission</h3>

  For part 1 the submission format is not so important, use the stub cabal package or
  just submit one or two .hs files if you prefer - as long as they contain appropriate
  commenting (you do not need to write any
  functions except the example for the first part, just type signatures).
  Make sure to answer the question asked in part one about defining the finite spiral using the
  infinite one! Omitting
  this is one of the few ways to fail on the first part.

  <p>

  For part 2 your submission needs to include the following:

  <UL>
  <LI>Your cabal package, containing your
  solution. Use "cabal sdist" to generate the source tarball. Make sure the tarball
  is working by extracting it in another directory and running "cabal configure",
  "cabal build" and "cabal haddock" and checking that everything looks right.


  <LI><B>report.txt</B> or <b>report.pdf</b>, a file containing documentation
  of what you have done: Also give the motivations you were asked to give in
  the assignments, answers to questions, and how to use your language.
  </UL>

  <P>

  Before you submit,
  please read the <A HREF="cheating.html">note on cheating</A>.

  <P>

  You are supposed to submit your solution using the <A HREF="https://xdat09.ce.chalmers.se/afp/">Fire system</A>.
  <p>
  Don't forget to submit when you have uploaded the files.
  <P>

  <A HREF="https://xdat09.ce.chalmers.se/afp/"><B>To the Fire System</B></A>

  <P>

  Good luck!
