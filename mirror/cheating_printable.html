	    <h1>Cheating</h1>
	</div>

       <div class=content>
	 
Sadly, previous events in other years have forced me to include this note on
    cheating on the course webpage.

    <P>

    Cheating is taken very seriously!

    <P>

    I will report a case of suspected cheating to the
    <A
    HREF="https://student.gate.chalmers.se/en/jointrulesanddirectives/rulesofdiscipline/pages/default.aspx">Disciplinary Commitee</A> for further investigation. In the worst case, this can lead to the
    student's exclusion from services such as lectures,
    computer rooms and exams. Please help me to avoid this to happen!

    <P>

    Here follow the rules of cooperation between students in this course.

    <P>

    Violating any of these rules might not be considered cheating by itself, but
    <B>violating any of these rules without informing me</B> is definitely
    considered cheating and, at discovery, will result in a report to the
    Chalmers or GU Disciplinary Committee.

    <UL>
    <P>

    <LI>One is allowed to orally discuss exercises and programming assignments
    with one another.

    <P>

    <LI>For the <B>programming assignments</B>, one is allowed to work in
    groups of size two. Once you have cooperated on an assignment with a
    particular person, you must submit your answer to that assignment together
    with that person, and can not cooperate with anyone else.

    <P>

    <LI>Apart from with your own lab partner, you are <B>not</B> allowed to share
    any piece of code with another student, by any means. Examples of ways which
    you cannot use to share code are: e-mailing code, printing out your code and
    giving it on paper, stealing other people's print-outs, faxing, dictating code
    over the phone, copying files with or without permission, reading someone
    else's email, reusing code from the web, etc.

    <P>

    Remember: it is equally wrong to give your code to
    another student as it is to use another student's code.

    </UL>

    <P>

    It is possible that exceptions to these rules are granted, but only if
    you talk to me as soon as the problem arises.
