	 <h2> Description </h2>
This assignment consists of 2 parts.
    <p>
    In the first part, you will design, implement and test a Monad for programs
    that can be <EM>replayed</EM>.
    <p>
    In the second part use this monad to implement a simple library for
    writing programs with web forms, implement an optimisation to your Replay monad that
    makes it much more useful, and use your web library to implement a simple
    application.
       </div>

<a name="replaymonad"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> A monad for replaying computations </h2>
<p>
    Consider the following scenario: A program is running. At some point, the
    program decides to stop, and produces a <em>trace</em>: a log of
    the computation so far.
    </p>
    <p>
    The user would later on like to restart the program, making it run from the
    exact same point it previously stopped on. Not only should the program point be
    the same, but all values of all variables should be precisely the same as when
    the program decided to stop. The trace should contain all information that is
    necessary to do this.
    </p>
    <p>The trace can thus be used as an input trace for rerunning the program,
    without repeating previously performed computations.</p>
    <p>
    In this lab you will implement a monad called <span class="codeSnip">Replay</span>
    for expressing such computations, capable of stopping to ask
    the user questions. This is the interface to the <span class="codeSnip">Replay</span> monad:
    </p>

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre codeBlock">
instance Monad (Replay q r)

io  :: (Show a, Read a) => IO a -> Replay q r a
ask :: q -> Replay q r r

run :: Replay q r a -> Trace r -> IO (Either (q, Trace r) a)
</pre></div>


    <p>
    The monad is parameterised on the type of questions (<span class="codeSnip">q</span>)
    and answers (<span class="codeSnip">r</span>, for result).
    There are two primitive operations in the monad besides <span class="codeSnip">return</span> and
    <span class="codeSnip">>>=</span>.
    The first one is <span class="codeSnip">io</span>, which allows us to perform IO actions.
    If there is already a result for this computation in the input trace, it will use this
    instead of performing the computation.
    </p>

    <p>
    The second one is <span class="codeSnip">ask</span>. It stops the whole program if
    there is no answer in the input trace for this question,
    returning the question along with the trace of what it has done so far.
    The user of the program can examine the question. When the
    user wants to continue the program they provide it with the generated trace
    extended with an answer. This time when <span class="codeSnip">ask</span> is run,
    it uses this answer instead of stopping the program.
    </p>

    <p>
    The <span class="codeSnip">run</span> function takes a <span class="codeSnip">Replay</span> program,
    and a trace (possibly produced by a previous run of the program), and reruns the
    program using this trace.
    If the program stops with a question <span class="codeSnip">q</span>, the result of the <span class="codeSnip">run</span> function is
    <span class="codeSnip">Left (q,t)</span>, where <span class="codeSnip">t</span> is the new trace.
    If there are no more questions, <span class="codeSnip">run</span> results in
    <span class="codeSnip">Right x</span> where <span class="codeSnip">x</span> is
    the result of the whole computation.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is important to note that <span class="codeSnip">Trace</span> is going to be something that we can
    serialise. For our purposes this means being able to convert from and to a
    a <span class="codeSnip">String</span>. Then we can for instance write it in a file.
    </p>

    <h3>An Example</h3>

    <p>
    Here is an example of a program in the <span class="codeSnip">Replay</span> monad. We have chosen the
    question and answer types to both be <span class="codeSnip">String</span>s:

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre codeBlock">
import Data.Time

example :: Replay String String Int
example = do
  t0 <- io getCurrentTime
  io (putStrLn "Hello!")
  age <- ask "What is your age?"
  io (putStrLn ("You are " ++ age))
  name <- ask "What is your name?"
  io (putStrLn (name ++ " is " ++ age ++ " years old"))
  t1 <- io getCurrentTime
  io (putStrLn ("Total time: " ++ show (diffUTCTime t1 t0)))
  return (read age)
</pre></div>

    The example starts by getting the current time and printing a message,
    then stops the whole program asking "What is your age?". If the program
    is rerun from that point with an answer, it prints another message and
    then stops again, asking: "What is your name?". If the program is rerun
    from that point, a message is printed, and the total time for the whole
    process is calculated.
    </p>

    <p>

    To understand how to deal with traces, here is a possible implementation for <span class="codeSnip">Trace</span>:

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre codeBlock">
type Trace r = [Item r]

data Item r = Answer r | Result String
  deriving (Show,Read)

emptyTrace = []
addAnswer t r = t ++ [Answer r]
</pre></div>

    When we run the above example, providing it with the empty trace, we get
    the following result:

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre ghciBlock">
GHCi> <EM>do x &lt;- run example []; print x</EM>
Hello!
Left ("What is your age?",[Result "1164117157",Result "()"])
</pre></div>

    We can see that the program printed the message, and then stopped, with the
    question "What is your age?", and a trace. The trace records what has happened
    in the program so far. When we have found the answer to the question,
    (for example, 27), we can re-run the computation, augmenting the trace with an
    extra element:

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre ghciBlock">
GHCi> <EM>do x &lt;- run example [Result "1164117157", Result "()", Answer "27"]; print x</EM>
You are 27.
Left ("What is your name?",[Result "1164117157",Result "()",Answer "27",Result "()"])
</pre></div>

    Again, the program prints its message, and stops with a question and a trace.
    Notice that we are running the <EM>same</EM> program (namely <span class="codeSnip">example</span>) again, but
    now with a different trace!

    <p>

    Again, we augment that trace with the answer we want to give, running the
    program again:

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre ghciBlock">
GHCi> <EM>do x &lt;- run example [Result "1164117157", Result "()", Answer "27", Result "()",
Answer "Starbuck"]; print x</EM>
Starbuck is 27 years old
Total time: 19 seconds
Right 27
</pre></div>

    We can see that the program printed "Starbuck is 27 years old" on the
    screen, and calculated how long time the whole process took (from the
    beginning). The program then terminated normally with the result 27.

    <p>

    We can automate the process of re-running the program and augmenting it
    with the answer every time. This is done by another run function that
    re-runs the program with an answer every time the program stops and asks a
    question. Here is how:

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre codeBlock">
running :: Replay String String a -> IO a
running prog = play emptyTrace
 where
  play t = do
    r &lt;- run prog t    -- this is the same prog every time!
    case r of
      Left (q,t') -> do
        putStr ("Question: " ++ q ++ " ")
        r &lt;- getLine
        play (addAnswer t' r)
      Right x -> return x
</pre></div>

    There is very little reason for why we would like to use this particular run
    function, because it does not use the full generality of the Replay monad. Here
    is how it works on the example:

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre ghciBlock">
GHCi> <EM>running example</EM>
Hello!
Question: What is your age? <EM>59</EM>
You are 59
Question: What is your name? <EM>Adama</EM>
Adama is 59 years old
Total time: 5 seconds
</pre></div>

    Note that, in the above, the same program is re-run with a new trace, each time the answer
    to the question is provided by the user.
       </div>

       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part I </h2>
<i>Deadline: Wed Feb 11</i>
    <p>
    The first part of this assignment is to implement the Replay monad.
       </div>

<a name="task1a"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part I - Task 1 - The Replay monad </h2>
First create a Haskell module called Replay in an empty directory, then
    create a cabal library package called replay by running <b>cabal init</b> and
    answering all questions. Look through the resulting cabal file and make sure
    you understand what it does and that your module is included in the package.
    Add any dependencies that you know you will need. Also you should relax
    the dependency on base to 4.* or similar.

    Implement a monad <span class="codeSnip">Replay</span> with the following interface:

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre codeBlock">
-- Types
Replay q r a
Trace r

-- Operations
instance Monad (Replay q r)
instance Show r => Show (Trace r)
instance Read r => Read (Trace r)

io  :: (Show a, Read a) => IO a -> Replay q r a
ask :: q -> Replay q r r

emptyTrace :: Trace r
addAnswer  :: Trace r -> r -> Trace r

run :: Replay q r a -> Trace r -> IO (Either (q, Trace r) a)
</pre></div>

    <p>
    You can decide yourself how to implement the type <span class="codeSnip">Trace r</span>, but
               it needs to be a type that can be written to and read from a
               file! (So, it needs to be an instance of <span class="codeSnip">Show</span> and
                                                        <span class="codeSnip">Read</span>.)
                                                        </p>

    <p>
    Make sure that the example above can actually be run correctly!
    </p>
       </div>

<a name="task1b"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part I - Task 2 - Generalise the interface </h2>
<h3>For grade 4 and 5</h3>
    <p>Turn your Replay monad into a monad transformer <span class="codeSnip">ReplayT m</span>,
    so that any underlying monad can be used, instead of only the <span class="codeSnip">IO</span> monad.
    Add a function <span class="codeSnip">liftR</span> for lifting computations from the underlying monad.
    Define <span class="codeSnip">Replay</span> in terms of <span class="codeSnip">ReplayT</span>:</p>

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre codeBlock">
type Replay q r a = ReplayT IO q r a

liftR :: (Monad m, Show a, Read a) => m a -> ReplayT m q r a
</pre></div>

    <p>Remember to generalise all functions to the new interface where possible.
    Consider which functions are primitive and which are derived.</p>
    <p><b>Question:</b> Why is in not possible to make your transformer an
    instance of MonadTrans?</p>
    <p>
    If you do this task, you should not submit the non-generalised version
    from Task 1.</p>
       </div>


<a name="task1c"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part I - Task 3 - Testing the Replay monad </h2>
<p>
  Once you have implemented your Replay monad transformer you should make sure that it
  works properly. Here is a testing framework to help you get started:
  <a href="files/Test.hs">Test.hs</a>.  Put the framework in a sub directory called test,
  then add this to your .cabal file to create a test suite:
  </p>

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre codeBlock">
Test-Suite test-replay
    type:            exitcode-stdio-1.0
    hs-source-dirs:  test
    main-is:         Test.hs
    build-depends:   base, replay
</pre></div>

  <p>
  If done correctly this sequence of commands should execute your test suite:
  </p>
<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre cabal">
cabal configure --enable-tests
cabal build
cabal test
</pre></div>

  <p>
  The idea of the framework is to test replay computations with integers as
  answers and whose only IO action is to increment a counter a number of
  times. We check that when running the program on a list of input integers
  we get the correct result and that the counter has the right value.
  </p>

  <p>
  You should write down enough test cases that you are confident that your
  implementation is correct. Try to think about possible corner cases.
  </p>

  <h3>For grade 4 and 5</h3>
  <p>Use the generalised interface from Task 2, and replace the IO monad with
  a State monad.</p>

  <h3>For grade 5</h3>
  <p>
  Use QuickCheck to generate random test cases.
  </p>
       </div>

	 <h2> Part II </h2>
<i>Deadline: Wed Feb 25</i>
    <p>
    In the second part of the assignment you will extend your library with a
    web programming DSL on top of the Replay monad and write an example application.
       </div>

<a name="web"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Web Programming </h2>
<p>
    In this section we will explore programming web forms using the Replay monad.
    We suggest to use the light weight Haskell web server
    <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty">scotty</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    A typical web-based system is as follows. A web page is sent to the
    user. The user fills in some information, and sends it to the server.
    The server looks at it, and sends new content, which is filled by the
    user, and so forth.
    </p>

    <p>
    A problem with programming web forms is the user's state: the inputted
    data so far, and the replies from the web server. It needs to be stored
    somewhere: either in the server, or in the client.
    </p>

    <p>
    If it is saved in the server, each client needs to somehow be
    identified, and the server state code can get quite complex: it is not
    clear what to do when the user uses the browser's "Back" to go back to
    an earlier state, or the browsers "Clone" button, often resulting in
    web pages with inconsistent information, or in the worse case breaking
    the server's database.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this part, we will explore the
    second alternative: store the state (or trace, if you will) on the
    client using the <span class="codeSnip">Replay</span> monad.
    </p>

    <p>
    Right below is a very simple web form program in Haskell using scotty. It
    produces a very simple HTML page, which contains a form. The user can
    provide information in the form and click OK. The program then
    gets the input of the form, and sends back a new web page. The client browser
    then reloads with this new web page.
    </p>

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre codeBlock">
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
module Main where

import Web.Scotty
import Data.Monoid
import Data.Text.Lazy

main :: IO ()
main = scotty 3000 $ do
    get "/" serve
    post "/" serve
  where
    serve :: ActionM ()
    serve = do
        i &lt;- getInput
        html (page i)

    getInput :: ActionM Text
    getInput = param "text_input_id" `rescue` \ _ -> return ""

    page :: Text -> Text
    page s = mconcat $
        [ "&lt;html>&lt;body>"
        , "&lt;p>Input was: ", s, "&lt;/p>"
        , "&lt;form method=post>"
        , "&lt;p>Type something here:&lt;/p>"
        , "&lt;input name=text_input_id>"
        , "&lt;input type=submit value=OK>"
        , "&lt;/form>"
        , "&lt;/body>&lt;/html>"
        ]
</pre></div>

    <p>
    This program can either be compiled and then run, or you can
    just issue <span class="codeSnip">runghc TestScotty.hs</span>. It will
    run a web server locally on port 3000, so you should be able
    to access it with your web browser on address
    <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Whatever is filled in in the form is given as input to the
    scotty program when the user presses OK. Try experimenting with adding
    more <span class="codeSnip">&lt;input></span> tags to the form and see how this affects the
    program. Both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods">GET and POST requests</a>
    are supported. Try changing the method in the form tag to get. You should
    see the inputted value in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">query string</a> of the address.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b><font color=Red>Make sure that you can run the above program and understand what is going
    on before you continue!</font></b>
    </p>
       </div>

<a name="task2a"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part II - Task 1 - A library for web forms </h2>
<p>
    The idea is now that you will now extend your replay library with web
    form programming, based on your Replay monad. This library should have
    the following interface:
    </p>

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre codeBlock">
type Web a = Replay Question Answer a

type Question = ?

type Answer = ?

runWeb :: Web ? -> ActionM ()
</pre></div>


    <p>
    In other words, the library provides a monad <span class="codeSnip">Web</span> that is used to
    communicate with a user, by exchanging web-pages, and receiving answers.
    </p>

    <p>
    The idea is that the programmer can send HTML forms to the user by
    using <span class="codeSnip">ask</span>.  When the user enters data in the form and sends it back,
    the <span class="codeSnip">Web</span> program is re-run up to the point where <span class="codeSnip">ask</span> was used, and
    continues with the answer that was gotten from the user.
    </p>

    <p>

    In order for this to work, you need to do the following.

    <ul> <li> <p>Decide how to represent the type <span class="codeSnip">Question</span>. This
                       somehow needs to be a representation of a web-form, that later
                       on will be sent to the user. You must support forms
                       with an arbitrary number of fields: it is not enough to give
                       a web interface like the simple string-based example from the
                       introduction. </li>
         <li> <p>Decide how to represent the type <span class="codeSnip">Answer</span>. This
                         needs represent the answer you get from the user. It needs
                         to be able to hold all the values filled in by the user. </li>
         <li> <p>Decide how to implement the function <span class="codeSnip">runWeb</span>. The
                         implementation will be very similar to that of the function
                         <span class="codeSnip">running</span>, but it also needs to take care of some web
                         stuff. In particular:
                         <ul> <li> <p>Run it in the scotty monad <span class="codeSnip">ActionM</span> with the right trace, and
                                                   grabbing the result, which will be a question
                                                   (web-form) and a trace. You can run IO computations in this
                                                   monad using
                                                   <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.3.0.0/docs/Control-Monad-IO-Class.html#v:liftIO">liftIO</a>.
                                           This can also be used to make your server print debug information.
                                           </p> </li>
                              <li> <p>Store the trace as "hidden" information on the
                                                   generated web-form. Hidden information can be
                                                   introduced by adding a tag like
                                                   <span class="codeSnip">&lt;input type=hidden name=<em>name</em> value=<em>value</em>></span> in a form.
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p>
                                           The value of the hidden input fields may not support certain characters,
                                           such as " and &lt;. You might need to encode it. One idea is to use
                                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64">base64 encoding</a>,
                                           for which there exists Haskell implementations:
                                           <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base64-string">base64-string</a>.

	 <h2> Part II - Task 2 - Optimising the Replay monad </h2>
<h3>For grade 4 and 5</h3>
    <p>

    The Replay monad remembers all results ever computed, even if they are
    not affecting the current computation anymore. This is not very
    space-efficient.

    <p>

    For example, if we would ask for the user's age like this:

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre codeBlock">
askAge :: ReplayT IO String String Int
askAge = do
     birth &lt;- ask "What is your birth year?"
     now   &lt;- io getCurrentYear
     return (read now - read birth)
</pre></div>

    Then every time we use this function, both results would be remembered in
    the trace forever, although we know we will never actually use the fact
    that we now know the user's birth year and the current year. Instead, we
    would like to just remember the age, and <EM>shortcut</EM> the trace there.

    <p>

    Implement a function:

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre codeBlock">
cut :: (Monad m, Read a, Show a) => ReplayT m q r a -> ReplayT m q r a
</pre></div>

    The idea with this function is <span class="codeSnip">cut m</span> should produce the same results
    as <span class="codeSnip">m</span>; it only affects the replay behaviour. Namely, when we replay
    the computation <span class="codeSnip">cut m</span>, and it has completed, only the result of
    <span class="codeSnip">m</span> is remembered, and none of the things that happened inside
    <span class="codeSnip">m</span> to make this happen.

    <p>

    Thus the user can use <span class="codeSnip">cut</span> to annotate their Replay programs and make
    them more space-efficient. For example, <span class="codeSnip">askAge</span> above could be
    implemented as follows:

<div class="codeDiv"><pre class="codePre codeBlock">
askAge' :: ReplayT IO String String Int
askAge' = cut askAge
</pre></div>

    In short, when you replay <span class="codeSnip">cut m</span>, one of three things can happen. (1)
    The replay-trace has not been here before. In this case, we enter <span class="codeSnip">m</span>
    and look inside.  (2) The replay-trace has been here before, but the last
    time we ran the program, somewhere inside <span class="codeSnip">m</span> we stopped at an
    occurrence of <span class="codeSnip">ask</span>. In this case, we enter <span class="codeSnip">m</span> and trace
    normally. (3) The replay-trace has been here before, and completed the
    computation <span class="codeSnip">m</span>. In this case, we never look inside <span class="codeSnip">m</span>, but the
    trace knows what the result of <span class="codeSnip">m</span> was, and we short-cut the tracing
    behaviour.

    <p>

    In order to implement <span class="codeSnip">cut</span>, you need to adapt your type <span class="codeSnip">Trace</span>.
    There needs to be a way for the trace to keep track of the fact if we
    should enter <span class="codeSnip">m</span>, or if we already know the result of <span class="codeSnip">m</span>.

    <p>

    Don't forget to add test cases for <span class="codeSnip">cut</span>. Again, think about corner
    cases such as <span class="codeSnip">cut (return 0)</span>.

       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part II - Task 3 - An interesting web program </h2>
Implement a more realistic example that uses your Web library. Add it as
    an executable called web in your cabal package, similarly to how the example
    in lab 1 was implemented.

    The following elements should occur in your program:

    <ul> <li> <p>The interaction with the user should go in several stages,
                             and information from previous interactions should be used later
                             on. </li>
         <li> <p>There should be a way for the user to make mistakes in
                             filling out the forms, and a way for your program to point this
                             out and to give the user a chance to fix the mistakes. For instance,
                             when asking the user about their age you should check that the answer
                             is a number and if it is not, scold the user appropriately and let them
                             try again. </li>
         <li> <p>
                             <h3>For grade 4 and 5</h3>
                             <p>
                             You should use <span class="codeSnip">cut</span> at the right places, to minimise the
                             size of your traces.
                             </p> </li> </ul>

    <p>
    Hint: remember that the monads scotty provides (ActionM and ScottyM) are
    instances of MonadIO and thus supports IO actions, so your program can
    interact with the server machine in any way. For instance you could make a
    little command shell that first takes a commands such as <b>ls</b>,
    <b>cd</b> and <b>cat</b>. For some commands it will then require parameters
    to be supplied (i.e. a file name). It then displays the contents of
    directories and files.
    </p>

    <p>
    Another idea would be one that fetches a given URL and transforms
    it in some way, for instance by asking the user for a two words and
    replacing one with the other. It then displays the modified page or writes
    it to a file on the web server and displays a link.
    </p>

    <p>
    A third idea is to implement a simple small spreadsheet matrix, where
    entries may either be numbers, or expressions referring to other cells
    (or blocks of them).
    </p>

    <p>
    These are considered ambitious to very-ambitious for the purpose of
    grading, the minimal requirements are lower.

	 <h2> More Information </h2>
(Feel free to send in suggestions.)

    <ul> <li> <p>For more information on HTML, there are lots of tutorials to
                      be found on the web. Here is a reasonable one:
                      <a href="http://www.htmlcodetutorial.com/">HtmlCodeTutorial</a>.
                      </p> </li>
         <li> <p>Query strings can not be arbitrarily long (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.2.1">RFC2616</a>).
                      It is therefore suggested to use POST instead. But browsers by
                      default do make a GET request when entering a web page from elsewhere
                      than from a form, so it needs to be supported to at least load
                      the page the first time.</p> </li>
         <li> <p>Don Stewart's guide on

	 <h2> Extra Assignments </h2>
These are completely voluntary, you can get grade 5 on the assignment
    without doing any of these.
    <ul> <li> <p>Add a layer for dealing with forms to your Web monad. For
                      example, it would be nice to not have give explicit names (as strings)
                      to the form-components. Instead, one can imagine "creating"
                      form-components (such as input boxes and buttons), and
                      being able to ask for their value after the user has entered the form.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      Is it possible for your DSL to support both the web front end and some other,
                      like gtk2hs?</p> </li>
         <li> <p>To protect your program from being fooled, add a
                      form of encryption in your traces. What safety guarantees can
                      you give with this protection? </li>
         <li> <p>Add a form of compression for traces, to avoid excessive amounts
                      of data being sent to and fro. Simply using show leads to lots of
                      extra clutter. One simple thing to do is to avoid printing the full
                      constructor names from the trace type. Another thing is to capture
                      repetition; many traces will have lots of repetitions of
                      <span class="codeSnip">(Result "()")</span> for example.
                      Would being able to say <span class="codeSnip">(Repeat 24 (Result "()"))</span>
                      bring down this cost enormously, or is it a case of premature optimisation?
                      What happens if you try a compression algorithm? </li>
         <li> <p>Similarly, examine the possibilities to use a more suited form
                          of serialisation than using <span class="codeSnip">Read</span> and <span class="codeSnip">Show</span>.
                          What libraries can you choose from there? </li>
         <li> <p>These days, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">Ajax</a> is probably
                      more common than page-reloading forms.
                      What would need to be passed from the scotty back end in such a setting?
                      Would you change the serialisation format?
                      Implement a small prototype. Spend minimal time on the JavaScript programming. </li> </ul>
