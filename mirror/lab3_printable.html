	 <h2> Description </h2>
<p>
    This lab assignment will require you to read, understand, evaluate and extend
    an advanced Haskell code base.
    </p>

    <p>
    You will choose an existing Open Source library package (preferably from
    <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html">Hackage</a>)
    and use it for a small project.
    </p>
       </div>

<a name="part1"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part I </h2>
Deadline: Sun Mar 1

    <p>

    This part of the lab is just for you to choose a Haskell library and
    motivate your choice. You should start the next part before the deadline of this one.
    <p>
    First choose a package on
    <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html">Hackage</a> which:
    <ul>
    <li>You think is interesting.</li>
    <li>Covers several of the <a href="index.html">Learning
    outcomes</a> of the course.</li>
    </ul>

    Then your task is to write a short report (1-2 pages) explaining why you
    chose this package, which learning outcomes you think it relates to, and
    how it relates to them. This report will be extended in Part II - Task 2.
    Also, write a preliminary description of what you intend to do for
    Part II - Task 1.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that for larger libraries, it may be intractable to consider the
    whole library. If so, you may select some well defined part of the library.
    </p>

    <p>
    Troubles deciding on a package?
    Visit the <a href="packages.html">package suggestion page</a>.
    </p>
       </div>

<a name="part2"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part II </h2>
Deadline: Sun Mar 15

    <p>
    You will now work with the library you have chosen.
    </p>
       </div>

<a name="task2a"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part II - Task 1 - Writing code </h2>
In this part you will write Haskell code that uses or extends your chosen library.
    The code could be in any one of these categories
    (or possibly a mix of them):

    <ul>

    <li>
    <p><b>Specification / QuickCheck testing</b>:
    Write a test suite of QuickCheck properties and generators for the library
    (or a part of it). Your test suite must demonstrate that you have in-depth
    understanding of both QuickCheck and (part of) the library under test. Can
    you find any bugs? If so, report them to the maintainer of the package - or
    even better: fix them!
    If you would like to use another testing library than QuickCheck for
    property based testing or specification, please contact us.
    </p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p><b>Modification / extension</b>:


    Show how the library could be changed to improve it in some aspect, or
    extend the library with some useful feature. Implementing the suggested feature is of
    course the best thing, but since this is a short project we understand if the
    result is limited to a partial solution or even a sketch of the implementation along with
    a description (in your report) of what difficulties you faced when trying to implement it.

    </p></li>


    <li>
    <p><b>Advanced usage / tutorial</b>:

    Show some examples of what the library can be used for. The examples must
    demonstrate a deep understanding of the library (or part of it). <b>Note:</b> This task
    is potentially much simpler than the other two. Making a good tutorial is enough for a
    passing grade on this assignment, but is unlikely to yield a higher grade.
    </p>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The expected work load for assignment 3 (all parts together) is around 40 hours.
    Try to demonstrate that you master (some of) the learning outcomes of the AFP course.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you have questions, talk to the teaching assistants (Dan and Anton).
    </p>
       </div>

<a name="task2b"></a>
       <div class=content>
	 <h2> Part II - Task 2 - Documentation </h2>
<p>
    Write a report about you have been doing in the lab.  The report should
    include:
    </p>

    <ul>

    <li><p>

    <b>Description of the library interface</b>:
    If the library has poor documentation, this is typically done by updating
    it with proper (<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haddock/">Haddock</a>)
    comments for the functions and modules it exports. You can then send this
    to the package's maintainer. If the documentation is already in good shape,
    write a summary in your report.

    </p></li>

    <li><p>

    <b>Description of the library implementation</b>:
    An explanation of some interesting techniques used in the implementation
    and perhaps other interesting things you have discovered about the library!

    </p></li>

    <li><p>
    <b>Analysis of your code</b>:

    An overview of the code you have been writing and a few highlights, for example
    particular problems that you faced and how you solved them.

    </p></li>

    </ul>

    Use concepts you have learned in the course to express yourselves.

	 <h2> Submission </h2>
<h3>Deadline</h3>

  The deadline for Part I is Sun Mar 1 and for Part II
  Sun Mar 15. The final deadline is Sun Mar 22.
  (Please read <a href="assignments.html#rules">the rules</a>
  on what first and final deadline mean.)

  <h3>Clean Code</h3>

  Before you submit your code, Clean It Up! Submitting clean code is Really
  Important, and simply the polite thing to do. After you feel you are done, spend
  some time on cleaning your code; make it simpler, remove unnecessary things,
  etc. We will reject your solution if it is not clean. Clean code:

  <ul>
  <li>Does not have long lines (&lt; 80 characters)</li>
  <li>Has a consistent layout</li>
  <li>Has type signatures for all top-level functions</li>
  <li>Has good comments</li>
  <li>Has no junk (junk is unused code, commented code, unnecessary comments)</li>
  <li>Has no overly complicated function definitions</li>
  <li>Does not contain any repetitive code (copy-and-paste programming)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Submission</h3>

  Your submission needs to include the following information:

  <ul>
  <li>Your Haskell files, containing your code. Typically this should be a cabal package.

  <li><b>report.txt</b> or <b>report.pdf</b>, a file containing your report.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Before you submit,
  please read the <a href="cheating.html">note on cheating</a>.
  </p>

  <p>

  You are supposed to submit your solution using the <a href="https://xdat09.ce.chalmers.se/afp/">Fire system</A>.
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>Note:</b> You do NOT have to use zip/gzip/tar/bzip on
  your files! Just upload and each file that is part of your
  solution. Don't forget to submit when you have uploaded all the files.
  </p>

  <p>
  <a href="https://xdat09.ce.chalmers.se/afp/"><b>To the Fire System</b></A>
  </p>

  <p>
  Good luck!
