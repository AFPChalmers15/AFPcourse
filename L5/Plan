* Learning outcomes
** DSL: design embedded domain specific languages
DSL.Implement: implement EDSLs in Haskell (as combinator libraries)
** Types: read, understand and extend Haskell programs which use 
   advanced type system features
Types.HOT: functors, monads and monad transformers
Types.Class: type classes, newtypes, deriving, ...
* Lecture overview
** Monad transformers
file:MonadT_API_summary.hs
file:mtl/Control/Monad/Reader.hs
Higher-order type + corresponding type class:
*** ReaderT r m a  +  MonadReader r m
*** StateT  s m a  +  MonadState  s m
*** ErrorT  e m a  +  MonadError  e m 
*** WriterT w m a  +  MonadWriter w m
** Running example: "Growing a language"
Starting from a trivial expression language with only numbers
and addition (file:src/Interpreter0.hs) adding features one by one:
*** Variables and let-binding
file:src/Interpreter1.hs
*** References (pointers to a heap) and state
file:src/Interpreter2.hs
*** Exceptions and error-handlers
file:src/Interpreter3.hs

* Base language:                  file:src/Interpreter0.hs
* Variables and let-binding:      file:src/Interpreter1.hs
* References and state:           file:src/Interpreter2.hs
* Exceptions and error-handlers:  file:src/Interpreter3.hs
* Preparation of "live-codeing" environment
# Remove old remains
rm -r live
mkdir live
# Copy all the "finished" files
rsync ./       live/
# Overwite some of them with incomplete files
rsync before/  live/
